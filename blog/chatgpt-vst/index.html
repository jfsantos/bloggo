    <p>Trying to create an "innovative" plugin from scratch using ChatGPT.</p>
<p>So... I recently left my job and decided I wanted to start experimenting with different projects entirely for fun ("reconnect with my passions" is part of my sabbatical resolutions). But I did not know where to start, and what do people do these days when they don't know what to do? They ask an LLM, of course, so that's what I did.</p>
<p>I first prompted it to treat me like a pal, because this is a collaborative project between pals and not some large complicated product. More specifically, I started the conversation being "let's drop the bs and be real with each other here". I did my best to translate quotes from ChatGPT to English here, because the chat originally happened in extremely informal Portuguese, with lots of slang and grammar errors. I was somewhat surprised that ChatGPT picked up on the minor slang/informal style I wrote in (which is mostly verbal, not written Portuguese) and did a decent job of replicating it.</p>
<p>What I told ChatGPT, what is suggested, my surprise at it peeking at our other chats to understand my interests, which project I chose. (also mention the annoying habit ChatGPT had of telling me what it thought I would choose)</p>
<p>You know what was the first thing I noticed about my new creative buddy? They're pretentious as fuck. Did that come from the language prompt, maybe, or does it always do that?</p>
<p>It makes lots of assumptions of how cool something is going to sound like while telling me to basically mess with the eq in a 5 band graphic equalizer clown-face</p>
<p>As the context gets long, it makes several mistakes, and starts forgetting things from the beginning (we're not using Projucer, we want bands to be decided dynamically based on the contents of each track, etc etc).</p>
<p>It ends up not being able to write to a WAV file (something it was doing perfectly in the test for several iterations) then blames the JUCE API for being "buggy" when it's actually just using it wrong.</p>
<p>Imagine being a music producer who learned everything from books but never heard a song or touched a volume knob before... but knows how to hype their product.</p>
<p>Are fully automated audio plugins the future??? Not yet, and certainly not while machines don't have ears that work like ours (at the very least).</p>
<p>BUT
Can I fully blame ChatGPT? Of course not. We should use tools knowing of their limitations and apply them for what they are good at. This is analog to complaining ChatGPT can't make me a cup of coffee; it probably knows and would tell me it cannot make me a cup of coffee, and ideally it should know about its other limitations as well.</p>
